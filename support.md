# What-Else - Support

**Last updated: February 20, 2026**

Welcome to What-Else support! Here you'll find help with common questions and issues.

## What is an Else?

In What-Else, we call your recurring tasks **"Elses"** — things you might not need to do right now, but shouldn't forget about. Whether it's watering your plants, changing your bedsheets, or calling a friend — an Else is anything that can wait, but not forever.

## Getting Started

### First Time Setup
1. Complete the onboarding tutorial
2. Sign in to iCloud for automatic sync across devices
3. Enable notifications in Settings → Notifications (optional)
4. Add your first Else!

### Creating Your First Else
- Tap the **+** button in the Dashboard
- Choose an emoji or SF Symbol icon (Pro users get access to 90+ professional icons)
- Enter a title and select an interval:
  - **Regular Intervals**: Every X days/weeks/months/years
  - **Scheduled Elses**: Specific days (e.g., every Monday & Friday, or 1st of each month)
  - **Dual Scheduling**: Combine both — e.g., "Every 5 days" + "Every Tuesday"
- Set a due date and optional reminder
- Optionally: assign a category, add a custom color, notes
- Tap **Add** to save

**Note:** Free users can create up to 8 Elses. Upgrade to What-Else Pro for unlimited Elses.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Syncing & iCloud

**Q: My Elses aren't syncing between devices**
- Ensure you're signed in to the same iCloud account on all devices
- Check Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud → ensure iCloud Drive is enabled
- Wait a few minutes for sync to complete
- Try force-quitting and reopening the app

**Q: I deleted the app and lost my data**
- If you were signed in to iCloud, your data should be automatically restored when you reinstall the app

### Elses

**Q: What's the difference between interval and scheduled Elses?**
- **Interval Elses** ("Smart Intervals"): Repeat every X days/weeks/months. The next due date only sets after you actually complete the Else — no stress if you're a day late
- **Scheduled Elses**: Occur on specific days:
  - **Weekly**: Select weekdays (e.g., every Monday and Thursday)
  - **Monthly**: Choose day of month (e.g., 1st or 15th of each month)
  - **Yearly**: Set specific date (e.g., March 15th every year)
- **Dual Scheduling**: You can combine both in a single Else!

**Q: How do I complete an Else?**
- Tap the progress ring on the right side of the Else card
- The Else will automatically be rescheduled based on its interval or schedule
- Your completion is recorded with On-Time Rate tracking

**Q: What is On-Time Rate?**
- On-Time Rate shows the percentage of times you completed an Else before it became overdue
- Each completion is recorded as either "on time" or "late"
- This helps you identify which routines work well and which intervals need adjusting

**Q: What do the ring colors mean?**
- **Red**: Else is overdue
- **Yellow**: Else is due today
- **Green**: Else is upcoming (not due yet)

**Q: Can I undo a completion?**
- Yes! If "Show Undo Button" is enabled in Settings → General, a 3-second undo button appears in the toolbar after completing an Else

**Q: How do I edit or delete an Else?**
- Tap the Else to open details, then tap **Edit**
- Or long-press the Else → **Edit**
- To delete: Else Details → **Delete** button

### Categories

**Q: How do categories work?**
- Create categories in Settings → Categories
- Assign categories when creating or editing an Else
- An Else can belong to multiple categories
- Use categories to organize and filter your Elses

### Notifications

**Q: I'm not receiving reminders**
- Check Settings → Notifications → ensure "Allow Notifications" is enabled in the app
